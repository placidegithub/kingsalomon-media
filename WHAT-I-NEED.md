# 📋 What Information I Need (Simple Explanation)

Don't worry! Let me explain what each thing means and why I need it.

---

## 1. Your Email Address

**What it is:**
- Your email address that you use regularly
- Example: `john@gmail.com` or `mary@yahoo.com`

**Why I need it:**
- To create a GitHub account (they send a verification email)
- To create a Render account (they send a verification email)
- I won't use it for anything else - just for account creation

**Example:**
```
Your email: johnsmith@gmail.com
```

## 2. Your Preferred Username

**What it is:**
- A name you want to use on GitHub
- This will be part of your GitHub profile URL
- Can be anything you like (letters, numbers, dashes)
- Examples: `kingsalomon`, `johnsmith`, `academy2024`

**Why I need it:**
- To create your GitHub account
- Your GitHub URL will be: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME`
- Your repository will be: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kingsalomon-academy`

**Example:**
```
Your preferred username: kingsalomon
```

**Note:** If the username is taken, GitHub will suggest alternatives.

## 3. Your Location

**What it is:**
- Your country or city where you are located
- Examples: `Rwanda`, `Gicumbi District`, `Kigali`, `Africa`

**Why I need it:**
- To choose the closest hosting server region
- Closer servers = faster website loading
- Options: US East, US West, Europe, Asia, etc.

**Example:**
```
Your location: Rwanda
```
or
```
Your location: Gicumbi District, Rwanda
```

**Note:** This is just to pick the best server location. You don't need to be exact!

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to give you my real email?**
A: Yes, because GitHub and Render need to verify your email. But I'll only use it to guide you through account creation.

**Q: Can I change my username later?**
A: Yes, you can change it on GitHub later if you want.

**Q: What if I don't know what username to pick?**
A: Just pick something simple like `kingsalomon` or use your name. You can always change it later.

**Q: Why do you need my location?**
A: Just to pick the best server location for faster website speed. If you're in Rwanda, I'll suggest the closest region.

**Q: Is this information safe?**
A: Yes! I'm just using it to create personalized instructions. You'll be creating the accounts yourself on the official websites (GitHub.com and Render.com).
